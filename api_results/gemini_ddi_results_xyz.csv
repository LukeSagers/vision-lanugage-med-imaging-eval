* Asymmetry: One half of the mole does not match the other half.
* Border: The border of the mole is irregular, ragged, or blurred.
* Color: The mole is not one uniform color. It may have different shades of brown, black, or red.
* Diameter: The mole is larger than 6 millimeters (about the size of a pencil eraser).

The risk factors for SCC include:

* Fair skin
* Sun exposure
* A history of sunburn
* A weakened immune system
* Certain genetic disorders

SCC is typically treated with surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the size and location of the lesion. In some cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be used.
